        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>To make this rich mac and cheese recipe healthier we use whole wheat bread crumbs, low-fat milk and cheese, whole wheat noodles, and reduced the amount of butter. Serve with a salad for a healthy meatless dinner.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) package whole wheat macaroni (such as Smart Taste)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>2-1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded low-fat Cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>3 cups low-fat (1%) milk</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1/2 cup whole wheat bread crumbs</li>
                <li>1 pinch paprika</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Step 1</h3>
                    <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.</p></li>
            
                <li><h3>Step 2</h3>
                    <p>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour to make a roux. Slowly add milk to roux, stirring constantly. Stir in Cheddar and Parmesan cheeses and cook over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce is thick, about 3 minutes. Place macaroni in large baking dish and pour sauce over macaroni. Stir well.</p></li>
                
                <li><h3>Step 3</h3>
                    <p>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add breadcrumbs and stir until butter is absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes. Spread over macaroni to cover. Sprinkle with paprika.</p></li>

                <li><h3>Step 4</h3>
                    <p>Bake in preheated oven until cheese sauce is hot and breadcrumbs are browned, about 30 minutes.</p></li>
            </ul>
